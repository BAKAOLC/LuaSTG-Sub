LuaSTG Ex Plus (ex+ branch), is a derivative branch of LuaSTG Plus (plus branch)
Maintained by Xiliusha, ESC, OLC

Since plus branch is no longer maintained, we created ex+ branch, fixed some bugs and added some new features.
(But now we're going to stop maintaining ex+ branch as well.)

runtime require:
    1. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    2. DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010) (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)

warn:
    The plus/ex+ branch is no longer adding new features and only fix bug.
    The plus/ex+ branch is difficult to maintain, bug fixes and add new features are maddening.
    The source code is temporarily closed source because I CAN ONLY COMPILE THEM WITH MAGIC!
    The source code will be republished after I fix the bugs I haven't fixed yet.
